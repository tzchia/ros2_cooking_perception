## To-Do List

- [ ] Setup ROS2 Environment & Workspace.
- [ ] Implement RGBT Splitter Node (RGB + Thermal visualization).
- [ ] Generate Dataset using Thermal-assisted labeling.
- [ ] Train Segmentation Model (YOLOv8-seg/SAM).
- [ ] Implement Real-time Inference Node.
- [ ] Analysis & Documentation.

## Library Survey

- **rclpy**: ROS2 Python client.
- **OpenCV**: Image processing & colormap application.
- **YOLOv11 (Ultralytics)**: Real-time instance segmentation (SOTA for speed/accuracy trade-off).
- **Segment Anything (SAM)**: For auto-labeling assistance.
